# Ansible: Tomcat for Banner 9

# Setup your environment

Install these tools:

vagrant https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads
virtualbox https://www.virtualbox.org




# usage

If it isn't there already, install ansible through the package manager of your choice.

Create an inventory file with a `webhost` group, containing the target webservers:

~~~
$ cat hosts 
[webhost]
mywebserver.mydomain.tld
~~~

Then run the playbook:
~~~
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml
~~~

This will generate a site with the examples specified in `roles/assg/vars/main.yaml`.

You might want to store site specific information along with blog posts in a separate YAML file. This way, you can manage multiple sites using the same playbook, but with different content.

Assuming your site's configuration is stored as so:
~~~
$ cat mycheeseblog.yml
---
# vars file for mycheeseblog.com
site_title: mycheeseblog.com
site_url: http://mycheeseblog.com

    target: http://linkedin.com/me
  -
    name: twitter
    target: https://twitter.com/me
  -
    name: github
    target: https://github.com/me

    target: http://coolthing.org

    I love cheese!
    This is my blog about eating a lot of cheese.

You could share your love of cheese with the following:
~~~
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml -e @mycheeseblog.yml
~~~

There is also a 'hidden' option to purge the contents of the target director first. To do that, run with:

~~~
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml -e @mycheeseblog.yml -e purge=true
~~~

To add a new blog post, update the `blog_posts` parameter and re-run the playbook. Though it is idempotent and there is no harm in running the full thing each time, you can generate just new posts and save some time by using the `posts` tag:
~~~
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml -e @mycheeseblog.yml --tags posts
~~~

Finally, I included a role I use to deploy apache on RPM based systems. If you are using something else, or don't require a webserver, you can remove it from the playbook, or just skip it with tags:

~~~
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml -e @mycheeseblog.yml --skip-tags apache
~~~


# fork it
This spits out a minimalistic website that suits my tastes, but obviously everyone is different. Think of this playbook as a starting point, providing some of the plumbing to deploy static sites. Take it, mess with the templates and style sheets and all that and do your thing.
